  Scenario: Edit a wordselect question
  #Changing to plain text mitigates slowness
    When I am on the "Course 1" "core_question > course question bank" page logged in as teacher1
    And I follow "Preferences" in the user menu
    And I follow "Editor preferences"
    And I set the field "Text editor" to "Plain text area"
    And I press "Save changes"
    When I am on the "Course 1" "core_question > course question bank" page logged in as teacher1

    When I choose "Edit question" action for "Word-select" in the question bank
    And I set the following fields to these values:
          | Question name            | Edited question name |
          | For any correct response |                      |
    And I press "id_submitbutton"
    Then I should see "Edited question name"
    And I choose "Edit question" action for "Edited question name" in the question bank
    And the field "For any correct response" matches value ""
